These are my first steps to give some solutions to the exercises in the Kernighan-Ritchie book. 
I did not mind the easiest ones :-)
One more thing:
   I have made this repository to learn git too... sorry for my mistakes

If someone find a very stupid error in my sourcecodes please do not hesitate to write a mail
to podrigabor@gmail.com

Thanks
